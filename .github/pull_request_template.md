**Current Behaviour**

- Describe how the bug manifests / how the current features are insufficient.

**What's Changed?**

- Describe what the behaviour would be without the bug or what the feature will do.

**Where should the reviewer start?** 

- Typically a particular file and pointers to direct the reviewer to the starting point to beg

**How should this be manually tested?** 

- The reviewer may not be familiar with this area of the codebase, or how to set up the right environment to verify the test case. 
- This is where commands will be listed for the reviewer to execute in order to set up the test, and run the code. Listing precise steps to test the code may be appropriate but often it’s general functionality that is described, leaving it up to the reviewer to step through the changes.
